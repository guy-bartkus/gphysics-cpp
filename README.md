Simulator for an alternative theory of physics proposed by [DraftScience](https://www.youtube.com/@DraftScience)

To get a quick summary of this alternative theory of physics, I recommend you watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pc8GOE4EmQ).

## Controls

Left click to add electron, right click for proton.
Space bar re-opens controls window.

## To Do List

- Currently working on getting matter to interact with other matter, but force bits currently interact with matter fine.
At the moment, matter simply phases through other matter.
- Find alternative to ImGui-SFML or make my own GUI. Seems to utilize OpenGL/GPU in very unoptimized manner.
- Organize code better.
- Add build information to readme.
- Need to add more information explaining details of the physics to this readme.
